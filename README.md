Predicting Bank Loan Default Using Machine Learning 
# Project Summary 
This project uses machine learning to explore a bank customer dataset to predict loan default risk. It applies a full predictive analytics workflow—covering data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation—to simulate real-world financial risk analysis. The findings aim to support better loan approval decisions for financial institutions. 
# Project Objectives 
Explore demographic and financial factors that influence loan defaults. 
Build and compare predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest). 
Evaluate model performance and interpret key features. 
Derive insights that help stakeholders mitigate financial risk. 
# Dataset Description 
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: **[Bank Loan Dataset by Zahra Zolghadr] (https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/zahrazolghadr/bank-loan?dataset_version_number=1)
It includes 9 columns and 850+ observations, covering features such as
Age, education level, years of employment, and income 
Debt ratio, credit card debt, and other debts 
Binary target variable: default (0 = no, 1 = yes)
